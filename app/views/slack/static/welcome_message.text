*Abot* has just been added to this team. It is a simple way to provide honest and *anonymous* feedback to other team members. From now on you use an `/abot` slash command.

Usage:

`/abot #channel_name message content` - anonymous channel message
`/abot @user_name message content` - anonymous direct message

Eg.

`/abot #general Last meeting was toooo long :(`
`/abot @tom I know what you did last summer.`

`/abot help` - display help
